# MicSens

Simple tool to keep your microphone input volume at a certain level, even if some applications like Microsoft Teams or Skype like to change the global volume automically.

## Usage

1. Copy `settings_sample.ini` to `settings.ini`
2. Run DeviceInfo and find out your `DeviceNumber` by changing the input volume of the target device.
3. Set the `DeviceNumber`, `TargetVolume` in `settings.ini`
